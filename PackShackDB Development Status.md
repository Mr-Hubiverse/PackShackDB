# PackShackDB Development Status

## üöß Current Development Status

### Working Features
- ‚úÖ Database initialization (8 tables created via init.sql)
- ‚úÖ File upload system
  - Successfully handles folder selection as upload target
  - Processes multiple files simultaneously
- ‚úÖ Basic metadata extraction
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database integration

### Known Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Download functionality is currently partially implemented
  - Button exists but may not function as expected
  - Downloads may fail or return incorrect files
  - UI may not provide proper feedback during download attempts

## üéØ Getting Started With Current Build

### Database Setup
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running
2. Verify init.sql script has executed successfully
3. Confirm the following 8 tables are present:
   - audio_files
   - categories
   - manufacturers
   - metadata
   - sample_packs
   - tags
   - user_collections
   - users

### Database Management Options

#### Command Line Verification
To check your tables via command line, use:
```bash
# Replace 'postgres-container' with your actual container name
docker exec -it postgres-container psql -U postgres -d packshack -c "\dt"

# For detailed table information:
docker exec -it postgres-container psql -U postgres -d packshack -c "\d+ audio_files"
```

#### pgAdmin Setup
For a better visual database management experience, you can use pgAdmin. Add the following to your docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    container_name: pgadmin
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: admin@admin.com
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: admin
    ports:
      - "5050:80"
    networks:
      - Lan  # Or your chosen network
    depends_on:
      - postgres
```

To access pgAdmin:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5050` in your browser
2. Login with:
   - Email: admin@admin.com
   - Password: admin
3. Add a new server:
   - Host: Your PostgreSQL container name
   - Port: 5432
   - Database: packshack
   - Username: postgres
   - Password: Your database password

### Using the Upload Feature
1. Click the upload button in the interface
2. Select a folder containing your audio samples
3. System will:
   - Process all compatible audio files
   - Extract metadata
   - Store file information in database
4. Monitor the upload progress through the UI indicators

## üìã Development Roadmap

### High Priority
- üîÑ Fix download functionality
  - Implement proper file retrieval
  - Add download progress indicators
  - Improve error handling

### Medium Priority
- Enhance metadata extraction
- Add batch processing options
- Improve error reporting

### Low Priority
- Add user authentication
- Implement file sharing features
- Create advanced search functionality

## üêõ Reporting Issues

If you encounter any problems:
1. Check if the database tables were created correctly
2. Verify your upload directory permissions
3. Check the console for error messages
4. Report issues through GitHub with:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - Error messages (if any)

## üí° Contributing

Currently accepting contributions for:
- Download functionality fixes
- Error handling improvements
- Documentation updates
- UI/UX enhancements

Please ensure all PRs include:
- Description of changes
- Testing procedures
- Any relevant documentation updates

## üîç Database Verification

Using pgAdmin or command line, verify your tables with:

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
```

Common database queries for verification:
```sql
-- Check total number of audio files
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM audio_files;

-- View all manufacturers
SELECT * FROM manufacturers;

-- Check sample pack contents
SELECT sp.name, COUNT(af.id) as file_count
FROM sample_packs sp
LEFT JOIN audio_files af ON af.sample_pack_id = sp.id
GROUP BY sp.name;
```

You should see all 8 tables listed in the results. If any are missing, re-run the init.sql script.
